**getme** is the tool for extracting HTML with a simple template

Why?
----

Writing a parser that extracts Web content is not difficult. What if the
website changes its structure, or we have to extract content from another
website? You'd likely to rewrite your code over and over again.

**getme** is created to help people minimize that effort. You don't have
to write code, but need to understand HTML structure enough to extract the
content.
